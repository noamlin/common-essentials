## Common Javascript Essentials which nodejs is missing
This library simply has a few easy to use and efficient functions which people commonly miss in nodejs.

The functions are:

1. **__stack** - an object that can be accessed globally and creates a stack trace
2. **__line** - an object that can be accessed globally and prints its line-number
3. **optionalArg** - a function for retrieving a default value for missing values in an optional options object
4. **nl2br** - a *new-line*-to-*break-tag* like PHP's nl2br function
5. **varDump** - PHP style var_dump for dumping a variables data to the console or for the browser
6. **tagLog** - normal console logging but with pretty tag prefixing each log
6. **errorLog** - normal console logging for errors with pretty prefixing each line
